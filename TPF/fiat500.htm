			<h2>Fiat 500L</h2>
			<p>Last summer I got to spend a lot of time pooteling around in a tin can - sorry - a 1969 Fiat 500L. Yes, the classic little Italian icon was my daily driver for a weekend and what an experience
				that was! Firstly, as a 6ft individual, I was afraid I wasn't going to fit in the thing, bus surprisingly, it's quite comfy! The car in question has a very peculiar story by the way. Recently
				purchased by it's now second owner, the car lived it's whole life in Rome, when it then made the journey to Brazil under Fiat BR's custody. For a couple of years, it was owned by the manufacturer
				which then sold it to the current owner - pretty cool if you ask me!

				<p>The little thing is so much fun to drive! I mean, 13hp (when new) won't get you pushed into your seat, but that's not the idea of it. It's an icon! Everyone stops and stares as you drive it,
					and to me, that's the fun of it. Double clutching the 4-speed, as there are no syncros, you can easily cruise around and enjoy the ride.

				<p>For me, the best part about it was taking it for ice cream on a Sunday afternoon! I mean, it looks like a scoop of vanilla! As you can see in the picture, the car is incredibly small, especially when
					comparing it to today's traffic. Easy to park and manouver, it will fit in any bike parking you can find, and that's great when driving around the streets of SÃ£o Paulo. In summary, I was extremely glad
					i got to experience this icon. We are used to horsepower wars and super high performing cars that we often forget how amazing a diled down classic can be. Everytime I got in it made me smile (apart from
					the time it wouldn't start, but that's a story for another time). Grazie Mille Ciqueciento!
