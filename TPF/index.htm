			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				This website started out as a WebTech assignment, but turned out as a passion project. Ever since a you age, I have always been involved 
				with the automotive world, that being cars or bikes. Aged 3 I started riding motorcycles, 
				and by 5 I was behind the wheel of a car and rowing gears. With this, racing became the next step, and slowly I migrated to driving a touch faster round circles on a track. 
				<p>The passion for road cars is a consequence of all this, and over this time behind the wheel, I have had the fortunate opportunity to drive some of the most amazing road cars
				out there. This hobby and passion of mine led me to research an learn all the intricacies of how cars work, differentiating what makes them look, feel
				and work as the best piece of machinery there is. Join me along this journey to unveil and experience the adrenaline these amazing cars can bring us!</p>
