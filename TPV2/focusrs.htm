			<h2>Ford Focus RS</h2>
			<p>Recently, I got to spend a good 2000mi with the angry Ford Focus RS - Ford's return to the magic rally hot hatch formula. As a lover of the hot hatch formula,
				I was thoroughly excited. As a general package, the RS carries a 2.3L EcoBoost 4cyl punching out a surprising 350hp and 350lbft of torque. Combined with a notchy
				6-speed manual gearbox and rear-biased AWD, the formula was guaranteed for success
			</p>

				<p>The car in question was a Shadow Black example with the desireable RS2 package, which adds alcantara inserts to the exquisite Recaro bucket seats, Sony HI-FI audio,
					forged lightweight 19" wheels and Nitrous Blue big pot Brembo's. Starting it up, i flicked through the 4 drive modes - Normal, Sport, Track and the all important 
					DRIFT! Yes, select Drift mode and the Quaife central diferential will send up to 80% of the power to the rear wheels, allowing you to well... DRIFT! As you can tell,
					I was very excited about this feature, as there is nothing like smoking some rubber in a hatch. Oh, the rally feels!
				</p> 
				<img src="rs2.jpeg" alt="m3t1" id="m3t">			
				<p>First impressions were: Impressive and direct steering, uber satisfying shifting, great driving position and wow! the power. This mighty EcoBoost delivers power in a very
					peculiar way. It doesn't feel turbocharged, yet not naturally aspirated. The small and spikey turbo spools quick, and at full boost coupled with the amazing AWD will shoot
					you out of corners just like a rally car it embodies. </p>
				<img src="rs3.jpeg" alt="m3t1" id="m3t">
				<p>As mentioned, I had the car for a couple of months, and over 2000mi, there were lots highway miles put on the odometer, which brings a particular aspect of the RS. To put
					long story short, 6th gear is well... short. At cruising highway speeds of 70-80mph, it will hold revs at 3500rpm, which may not seem much, but consider this performace hatch
					has a quite lout exhaust and engine note. I would classify it as boomy or drone, but it is definitely present as a note with your music. Following on from this, 3500rpm over long
					periods of time combined with a 10 gallon gas tank means you are constantly visiting the station over the period of 160-200mi depending on how heavy you right foot is. Averaging
					14-6mpg in the city and 18-20mpg on the highway is quite depressing to say the least.
				</p>
				<img src="rs4.jpeg" alt="m3t1" id="m3t">
				<p>Overall, I was in love with the mighty RS. The looks, the drive and the feel just makes it a perfect package for the ultimate daily rally car - if that even is a thing. For the price,
					there is not much that beats it. Plus, if you buy one now, which I would really recommend, hold on to it and take care, as the rare hatch will only appreciate over time. Thank you Ford
					for making this brilliant piece of machinery.
