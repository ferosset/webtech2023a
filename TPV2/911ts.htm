			<h2>Porsche 911 Turbo S</h2>
			<p>When every new Porsche generation is introduced, we are all in dire urge to see how insanely fast the Turbo model will be. Well, I drove one recently and surprise surprise,
				its balistically fast. Like face bending fast. The recent 992-Gen has given the Turbo and Turbo S variants a strong upgrade overall. Wider, grippier, and much more powerful.
				the 3.8 Flat Six now makes 680hp which is 20hp less than the last gen, benchmarking GT2RS. Sending its power to all 4 wheels via a new 8 speed PDK transmission, the package
				as always was designed to deliver.

				<p>Draped in a questionable Python Green paint and clad in black Race-Tex throughout the interior with matching Python Green stitching, the striking frog was dressed to impress.
					Spec aside, I had a quick 30 minutes to drive the Turbo S, of which I made the most out of it. So let me make this review as fast as the car. Race mode and traction off, left foot
					on the brake pedal, full throttle and let go. In 2.3 seconds you are doing highway speed limits and by the time the lighting quick PDK shifts into 2nd gear, you are in jail.
					I have never experienced power like this. No tyre squeal at all, just full boost and traction off the line. This thing is insane.

				<p>The couple of corners through the tight and twisty <a href="aldeiadaserra.com.br">Aldeia da Serra</a>, I was able to grab the green beast by the scruff of its neck and see what the AWD
				as all about. Surprisingly, it feels mostly RWD. With all the electronic nannies switched off, the car squirms under power and slides on corner exit faster than you would expect. Playing around
				it gets a bit twitchy, as once the boost fully kicks in, the AWD tractions up and the front end pulls back into line. It is happier under lift off provocative oversteer rather than powerslides.
				The massive 10 pot PCCB (Porsche Carbon Ceramic Breaks) are, as the lauch control, mind bending. Stomp on the big yellows and you better be holding your head not to smash it against the windshield.

				<p>I always wanted to experience the hype of a 911 Turbo, be it the original 930 or the latest 992. They say never meet your heroes. Today I met mine, and it didn't disappoint. What a car! Performance x Price,
					there is nothing on the market that beats it.
