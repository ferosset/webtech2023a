			<h2>Ferrari F12 TDF</h2>
			<p>Bucket list moment. Enjoy this as much as I did. When the Ferrari F12 TDF came out in 2018, superceeding the iconic 599 GTO, there was a lot of expectation on the track focused
				front-engined V12 machine from Maranello. Magazines, journalists and enthusiasts went crazy over the TDF. The 6.3L atmospheric V12 was shoved in from the LaFerrari into the F12
				Berlinetta chassis and decorated with air bending bits to make it go faster around corners. Limited to 799 units worldwide, the chance of seeing one out in the wild is quite slim,
				and driving it probably impossible. I had the very fortunate opportunity to test out one recently, and what an experience it was.

				<p>TDF - Tour de France, a nod to the late great 250 TDF from the 60's, the F12 TDF carries details all over from the classic, such as the rear vents and ducktail. Apart from the name 
					and minor design traces, the track weapon was sculped under the wind tunnel, differentiating it from the "normal" F12 model. The wider track and addition of rear-wheel-steering
					creates a sort of "virtual" short wheel base which allows the TDF to not only corner tighter, but faster as well. In fact that was the feature that most stood out as I drove the car 
					around at slower speeds. But slower speeds is not fun, so crack it up to Race mode on the Manettino and let those 12 cylinders sing!

				<p>Driving shouldn't be the term used to describe the use of an F12TDF. The high pitched symphony coming out of those titanium pipes combined with the crisp dual clutch gearbox is like
					playing an instrument. The aural event this thing makes at 9000rpm is like nothing I have ever felt before. Every gear shift is a bang and burst of adrenialine - forget your espresso shots!

				<p>And then there is the looks. Oh my the looks. For me, it's the very best looking Ferrari since the F40. The delicate yet agressive lines that run over the Rosso Corsa paintwork in contrast with
					the glistening carbon fiber around the outside trim is top notch; exquisite. Not much beats the TDF, N/A, V12, RWD and very, very red. It's the perfect formula, and when coupled with some racing
					heritage sprinkle, there's just nothing that really beats it. Che macchina!
