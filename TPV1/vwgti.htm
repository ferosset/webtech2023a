			<h2>Volkswagen Golf GTI</h2>
			<p>When Volkswagen debuted the Golf GTI in the fall of 1975 at the Frankfurt motor show, they created one of the most competitive segments in the enthusiast car industry. The Golf was a people's car, 
				small and inexpensive, with slightly more luggage capacity than the competitors compact sedans. While it was sufficient for the everyday consumer, the niche audience of car enthusiasts wanted more. 
				The GTI variant, or grand tourer injection, had a more powerful engine than standard, and slightly stiffer suspension to help with cornering agility. 
				Forty years later, the seventh generation of the GTI was released, designated the Mark 7. The car being tested for the review is a 2016 model year, and is my personal car that I have owned since July of 2020. 
				It is now September of 2021, and I have put roughly 13 thousand miles on the odometer. Plenty of seat time to feel out every inch of the German hot hatch.

				<p>Let’s talk about what I feel is the GTI’s best attribute, its dual personality. Consumers who buy a hot hatch are usually in this market because they only want one car to do it all. While there are always exceptions, 
					this is usually the case. I have found that whatever my driving mood is, the GTI is able to match that perfectly with no complaint. With the DCC, Dynamic Chassis Control set to comfort, the electronic dampers slacken off, 
					and provide a ride that would be categorized as much more expensive than its price point. Highway cruising in comfort is effortless as well. In sixth gear at 75 mph, the GTI sits at a comfortable 2,300 rpm, just enough to 
					keep it from bogging on itself, but right in the sweet spot of its best fuel economy. While Volkswagen rates the GTI at 25 city and 34 highway mpg, with my manual gearbox I average about 22 city and 32 highway. The manual 
					is a huge deciding factor in that result compared to the optional dual clutch automatic. 
					While cruising around town or running errands, I often find myself in normal for DCC. The dampers become slightly more firm, but a perfect balance for everyday driving. Up in the Bangor Maine region, our roads are less than
					 ideal for car suspension. But the GTI has little complaint. I prefer normal over comfort around town due to the slightly sharper steering and throttle response, which feels more natural in everyday conditions.

				<p>On open roads, DCC in sport really does prove to be beneficial. The dampers are in their stiffest setting, while still not being so solid that it rattles your spine over every bump. The electronic power steering is given more
					 weight, to help reassure where the driver is putting their front tires. Throttle response is tightened up as well, benefitting the GTI under acceleration out of corners. My personal car, the 2016 performance pack, has a few 
					 factory upgrades over the standard car that really help the experience behind the wheel. The performance pack boasts 10 more horsepower, slightly larger brakes off of the Golf R, and a limited slip differential between the 
					 front wheels. The electronically controlled LSD is easily the most important aspect of the pack. The ability to manage and balance how much power is going to each front wheel gives the driver much more control in a straight 
					 line and in corners. When cornering in the GTI, the computers on board realize that the outside wheel needs to spin faster than the inside to help prevent understeer, so it manages that power to the outside to help pull the 
					 car out of corners. It is quite a strange feeling at first, but addicting once you get used to the feeling. 
					Power in the GTI comes from its 2.0 liter inline four turbo, the fourth generation of Volkswagen's EA888 engine platform. Volkswagen claims it produces 220 horsepower (in performance pack models) and 258 pound foot of torque. 
					Plenty of power for daily driving and The clutch is feather light, and I have no complaints over the past 13 thousand miles. Grabbing point is high and smooth, with little effort needed by the gas pedal. Rowing through the six 
					speed gearbox is satisfying, and keeps the driver engaged. While it is not the cleanest box, it is more than sufficient for daily driving, and fun back roads on the weekend. 
					 </p>

				<p>Moving inside the GTI, the aesthetic is much more mature than its competitors, the Focus ST and Veloster Turbo. The design screams Audi, and the materials reflect that as well. Felt lined door pockets, the leather wrapped flat 
					bottom steering wheel, and well bolstered but comfortable seats to name a few. All of the controls are easy to find, intuitive, and have a satisfying feeling upon use. While MIB II, the version of Volkswagen’s infotainment system 
					in this car works well, I simply plug my iPhone into the USB slot and use Apple Car Play. Space in the back seat is decent, comfortably fitting children and shorter adults under 5’9”. Anyone taller may feel slightly cramped, due 
					to the short length of the hatchback design. 
					While it may seem like I am gushing over Volkswagen's hot hatch, there are a couple aspects of the car that I am not too keen about. When pushing the car to the very limit in the corners, the electronic power steering can feel 
					slightly numb. Even on Firestone Firehawk Indy 500 rubber, there is slight uncertainty at near max G forces. In the engine department, I wish the GTI had a slightly louder exhaust note. While this is completely subjective, I feel 
					like the general audience that will be in the market for this car would appreciate more volume as well. The audible feedback of the engine is more engaging, and heightens the senses during spirited driving. Finally, I’ll come to the price. 
					In 2016, my car which is the middle SE trim, performance pack and manual, had a sticker price of $36,500. That’s a lot of money for a Golf. Is it worth it, when you start to approach Audi A3 prices? While I didn’t pay nearly that much on the 
					used market in 2020, new GTI’s still follow the same pricing scale, if not slightly more than five years ago.

				<p>After roughly 13 thousand miles, I have no regrets about making this purchase. It has served me well and has done everything I have asked it to do and more. Every press of the throttle still manages to put a smile on my face, and I plan on 
					keeping this car for a very long time, if not forever. It fills the space in my garage as the perfect daily driver while still giving enthusiasts something to look forward to when they sit behind the wheel. If you’re in the market for a hot hatch, 
					the Mark 7 GTI should be given serious consideration.
