			<h2>BMW M2 Competiton</h2>
			<p>With the introduction of the new F87 2-Series chassis in BMW’s lineup, 
				the subsequent M variant had soon to be released. In 2015, we saw the fantastic M2 hit the streets and tracks, conquering die-hard M fans with the pocket rocket we all missed; bringing 
				some passion and heritage that harks back to the legendary E30 M3. Both in size and dynamics, the M2 was a full plate of BMW M’s finest fun-haver, though for the purists, there was still 
				something missing - a true M ‘S’ designated engine. Now, however, there needs no worrying. 
			</p>

				<p>The recently released 2021 M2 Competition has been facelifted, and packs its bigger brothers M3/4 drivetrain, the proven “S55B30” 3.0L Twin Turbo Inline 6cyl, making a healthy 410hp and 
					550Nm of torque all through its 7200rpm redline. In addition, new styling features such as the more aggressive front bumper, M mirrors, rear diffusor and an interior clad in Alcantara and
					carbon fiber adds to the sauce previously missed in the first gen M2. And worry not, enthusiasts, the baby M can be optioned with a Getrag 6-speed manual or an M-DCT 7-speed.
				</p>

				<p>To understand what the hype was all about, I had to take the M2 Competition out for a hoon. Location? The winding backroads outside Cabreuva, São Paulo; Estrada dos Romeiros to be more specific. 
					I was lent a stunning spec’d Diamond Schwartz Metallic (one of the 5 optional colors for the M2C) over Black/Blue car, and to make the experience that much better, it was a manual! It was time to
					 hit the bright red Start/Stop button and go for a drive.</p>
				<img src="m2c3.jpeg" alt="m3t1" id="m3t">
				<p>The first part of the day took me from São Paulo to Pirapora, about a 30-minute highway slog, which allowed me to experience the M2C’s mundane characteristics. BMW’s new pairing of iDrive 6 and Harmann 
					Kardon speakers allows for a pleasant music listening experience with a hint of engine noise in the background. The bucket seats are fantastic, probably the best feature of the interior, I would say. 
					Driving ergonomics are spot on with the right adjustments of lumbar and bolster support, and the telescopic rack has plenty of movement. The only gripe I had was tire noise. There was significant droning 
					coming from the Michelin Pilot Super Sports, but then again, this is not a Grand Tourer. Arriving at the mountain pass, I played around with the M Driving Modes now available in the Competition variant. 
					Switching from Efficient, to Sport and Sport+ both for drivetrain and steering, I could feel the car waking up; the difference if significant, I must say. The more aggressive settings for both parameters 
					enhance the throttle sensitivity by 15%, opens the exhaust valves and sharpens up steering feel, perfect for the next part of the drive.

				<p>Let’s talk engine. The powerband is completely different from the previous gen. 
					The new parallel turbos deliver linear boost all the way to redline, whereas the regular M2’s single turbo lagged until it was fully spooled up and would fall on its face once it reached fuel cut. There 
					is no denying that the Bavarian’s 6 cylinders are characterful, but the new S55 has an added elasticity to it, very similar to the E46 M3’s S54, just turbocharged. It is silky smooth on power, and don’t 
					get me started on the overruns! The burbles and pops will leave you smiling from ear to ear. 
					This experience was made better by the gearbox. BMW has been getting a lot of slack lately for its “rubbery” shifting feel, but I disagree. Every change is notchy, direct, and precise. It slots perfectly 
					into the gates; very satisfying. The auto-blip feature must be mentioned as well.

				feel like a driving God! Turning traction control off solves this problem, though. Just be careful when doing so, as those 410hp can light up the rears in a heartbeat, and the short wheelbase will happily 
				swap ends and send you spinning off the beaten path.

			<p>Once the road got tighter and twistier, the revised short ratio steering rack came to life. Point the front end in and hold on. In conjunction with the Bilstein dampers and carbon strut brace, the M2C has 
				gained life in the feel department, to the point at which you could run over a chocolate wrapper and tell what brand it is. Under heavy load, the Limited-Slip differential hooks up and puts the power down. 
				There is tremendous grip from the Pilot Super Sports (Front: P245/35R19, Rear P265/35R19) at all four corners, though it is just a matter of hitting the quick configurable M1/M2 buttons on the steering wheel 
				to turn on MDM or TC OFF and have fun smoking up some big drifts.
				Now, there needs to be some mentioning in the styling updates. The M2 Competition now gets a new front bumper with more aggressive intakes, sharper kidney grilles, and ducts for the flat oil cooler that sits 
				flush with the undertray. Moreover, the M Mirrors are also borrowed from the M3/4, which was definitely a missing feature from the previous gen. Exterior wise, the M2 if by far the best-looking current BMW, 
				in my opinion. The flared fenders and bolstered hips packs a pugnacious punch of anger. Unlocking the car and seeing those four angel eyes light up on a wide stance, you can be sure the car is inviting you for 
				a riot drive out. Inside it is much of the same. Dakota leather all round with hints of Alcantara woven by blue stitching. The bucket seats glow up the M2 badge, which is a quirk, but adds to the drama. Overall, 10/10.

			<p>At a starting MSRP of $58,900, I cannot think of a better sportscar that delivers both comfort-quality and adrenaline rushing performance. TTRS? Cayman GTS? Both are well over the $60k mark with no options, and at that 
				point, I would be doubtful if they deliver that much fun. Front engine, rear-wheel-drive, manual cars are a dying breed in today’s age of turbocharging and downsizing. Us enthusiast should celebrate the moment whilst we 
				still can, to burn some rubber and high-octane petrol, as these fun sportscars will not be around for that much longer.
